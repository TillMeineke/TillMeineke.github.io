# Till Meineke's data analytics and ML portfolio projects

This repository contains a collection of data analytics and machine learning projects that I have worked on. The projects are written in Python and are primarily based on Jupyter notebooks. The projects cover a wide range of topics, including data cleaning, data visualization, statistical analysis, machine learning, and deep learning.
